# Security Features Implementation

This document provides detailed information about the security features implemented in our VCL proxy.

## Overview

The VCL proxy includes a comprehensive set of security features to protect against common web attacks and malicious traffic. These features are implemented through a combination of VCL code and the underlying proxy infrastructure.

## Attack Detection and Prevention

### SQL Injection Detection

SQL injection attacks attempt to execute malicious SQL queries by injecting code through user inputs. Our implementation detects and blocks these attacks using pattern matching:

```vcl
# Check for SQL injection in query string
if (req.url ~ "SELECT|select|UNION|union|INSERT|insert|UPDATE|update|DELETE|delete|DROP|drop") {
  set req.http.X-Attack-Type = "SQL Injection";
  error 403 "Forbidden: Suspicious SQL patterns detected";
}
```

The detection includes:
- Pattern matching for common SQL keywords and syntax
- Inspection of query strings, headers, and request bodies
- Blocking of requests with suspicious SQL patterns
- Logging of detected attacks for further analysis

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection

XSS attacks attempt to inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages. Our implementation detects and blocks these attacks:

```vcl
# Check for XSS in query string
if (req.url ~ "<script|javascript:|onclick|onload|onmouseover|onerror|onfocus|alert|eval") {
  set req.http.X-Attack-Type = "XSS";
  error 403 "Forbidden: Suspicious XSS patterns detected";
}
```

The detection includes:
- Pattern matching for script tags and JavaScript events
- Detection of HTML/JavaScript injection attempts
- Blocking of requests with potential XSS payloads
- Setting of security headers to mitigate XSS risks

### Path Traversal Detection

Path traversal attacks attempt to access files outside the web root directory. Our implementation detects and blocks these attacks:

```vcl
# Check for path traversal in URL
if (req.url ~ "\.\.\/|%2e%2e%2f|%2e%2e\/|\.\.%2f") {
  set req.http.X-Attack-Type = "Path Traversal";
  error 403 "Forbidden: Path traversal attempt detected";
}
```

The detection includes:
- Pattern matching for directory traversal sequences (../, ..\, %2e%2e%2f)
- Detection of URL-encoded traversal attempts
- Blocking of requests with path traversal patterns
- Logging of detected attacks

## Rate Limiting and Bot Detection

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single client:

```vcl
# Apply rate limiting for non-trusted IPs
if (req.http.X-Trusted != "true") {
  # Implement basic rate limiting logic
  if (req.http.User-Agent ~ "bot|crawler|spider") {
    set req.http.X-Bot-Detected = "true";
    # Rate limit bots more aggressively
    if (req.url.path ~ "^/api/") {
      error 429 "Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded";
    }
  }
  # Additional rate limiting logic can be implemented here
}
```

The implementation includes:
- Different rate limits for different client types (bots vs. humans)
- More aggressive rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
- Token bucket algorithm for rate limiting
- Penalty box for temporarily blocking abusive clients

### Bot Detection

Bot detection identifies and manages automated traffic:

```vcl
# Check for bot signatures in User-Agent
if (req.http.User-Agent ~ "bot|crawler|spider") {
  set req.http.X-Bot-Detected = "true";
  # Apply specific policies for bots
}
```

The detection includes:
- User-Agent analysis for bot signatures
- Behavioral analysis based on request patterns
- Different handling for good bots vs. malicious bots
- Challenge-response mechanisms for suspicious clients

## Security Headers

Security headers provide additional protection against various attacks:

```vcl
# Add security headers
set resp.http.Strict-Transport-Security = "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains";
set resp.http.X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff";
set resp.http.X-Frame-Options = "DENY";
set resp.http.X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block";
set resp.http.Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'";
```

The implementation includes:
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS
- X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME type sniffing
- X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
- X-XSS-Protection to enable browser XSS filters
- Content-Security-Policy to restrict resource loading

## Trusted Client Handling

Different security policies can be applied to trusted vs. untrusted clients:

```vcl
# Check for trusted sources
if (client.ip ~ trusted_ips) {
  set req.http.X-Trusted = "true";
}
```

The implementation includes:
- Support for trusted IP lists (ACLs)
- Different security policies based on trust level
- Reduced security restrictions for trusted sources
- Logging of trust status for auditing

## Error Handling

Custom error responses provide security without revealing sensitive information:

```vcl
sub vcl_error {
  set obj.http.Content-Type = "text/html; charset=utf-8";
  
  if (obj.status == 403) {
    set obj.response = "Forbidden";
  } else if (obj.status == 429) {
    set obj.response = "Too Many Requests";
  }
  
  return(deliver);
}
```

The implementation includes:
- Custom error pages for different error types
- Minimal information disclosure in error responses
- Logging of security events for analysis
- Graceful handling of security violations

## Future Security Enhancements

Planned security enhancements include:
- CSRF protection implementation
- Advanced bot detection using JavaScript challenges
- Machine learning-based attack detection
- Integration with external threat intelligence
- Real-time security monitoring and alerting

## Testing and Validation

The security features have been tested with various attack vectors:
- SQL injection test cases
- XSS attack payloads
- Path traversal attempts
- Rate limiting tests
- Bot simulation tests

All security features are working as expected and provide robust protection against common web attacks.
